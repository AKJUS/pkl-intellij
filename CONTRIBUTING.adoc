To file a bug or feature request,

* The complete error message, including stack trace (if available).
* The simplest possible steps to reproduce.

== Pull Requests

When preparing a pull request, follow this checklist:

 * Imitate the conventions of surrounding code.
 * Verify that the build (`./gradlew build`) succeeds.
 * Follow the {uri-seven-rules}[seven rules] of great Git commit messages:
 ** Separate subject from body with a blank line.
 ** Limit the subject line to 50 characters.footnote:not-enforced[This rule is not enforced in the Pkl IntelliJ project.]
 ** Capitalize the subject line.
 ** Do not end the subject line with a period.
 ** Use the imperative mood in the subject line.
 ** Wrap the body at 72 characters.footnote:not-enforced[]
 ** Use the body to explain what and why vs. how.

we encourage you to first discuss them with the Pkl team.
